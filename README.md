## âœ¨ Features

- Load your own images or generate synthetic patterns (stripes, circles, squares, etc.)
- Apply **point operators** (negative, gamma, brightness/contrast, thresholding, etc.)
- Add different types of **noise** (Gaussian, uniform, salt & pepper, speckle)
- Explore **local filters** (mean, Gaussian blur, median, sharpen, custom 3Ã—3 kernel)
- Detect edges with **Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian**
- Perform **histogram equalization** and stretching
- Visualize **histograms, LUTs, transfer curves**
- Compute **2D Fourier Transform** (amplitude and phase, linear/log view)
- Undo/redo and download results
